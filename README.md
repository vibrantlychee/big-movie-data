Are there unstoppable casts and crews that seem to make hit after hit (👀  Steven Spielberg)? Are there casts and crews who are costing studios hundreds of millions every year (👀  Will Smith)? 

🤑  What might determine the financial success of a film? Can we predict the revenue of a film?

😿  Can we label the genre(s) of a film (action, comedy, romance, drama, etc.) without watching the film? For example, using features such as title, cast, and crew? How might we deal with the fact that movies can have multiple labels (e.g. romantic comedy, action comedy)?

🏆  What makes a film worthy of an Oscar? Although there is no criteria for Best Picture nominations (pre-2024), is there some underlying pattern?

Data science may be able to provide an answer these (but probably not).
